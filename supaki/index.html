                <p>SUPAKI is a versatile eCommerce solution for mobile games that supports direct-to-consumer in-game item sales as well as successful player engagement techniques. SUPAKI is a comprehensive system that offers online stores to game development companies. SUPAKI enables these companies to sell in-game items to gamers, offer personalised promos, and even give away prizes. SUPAKI, as a third-party solution, is more than simply an Android app; it is a suite of products that provide a cost-effective and efficient means for companies to operate their stores outside of the game, reducing the need for internal development. Players can quickly purchase certain things via the SUPAKI Android app and have them delivered directly to their in-game accounts.
